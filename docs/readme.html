</p><h1><a name="WELCOMEOVERVIEW"></a>WELCOME/OVERVIEW</h1><br>
Welcome to PolyGlot, an <a href="https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot">open
source</a>
tool set that helps to build constructed languages (conlangs)! PolyGlot
is a project that I have been working on for some time, and it
continues to become more and more capable with each release. If you
have ideas, find bugs, or have any comments at all, please feel free to
email me at <a href="mailto:draquemail@gmail.com">draquemail@gmail.com</a>!


<h1><a name="-----_ii_-----"></a>WHAT’S NEW</h1><br>As always, there
have been some upgrades/improvements to PolyGlot that are beneath the
surface, helping to keep it running with fewer bugs and more
reliability, but here are the ones that you’ll be interested in. The
new class system is the last original piece of PolyGlot (around since v
0.6) that absolutely had to be replaced. It was a limiting system that
was applied to all words, regardless of type. I have added a class
system that allows as many classes with as many possible values as you
care to add. And they can be specifically linked with parts of speech,
so the menu won’t be cluttered up with a “gender” value if you’re
creating a particle or verb. Unless your language genders those! <br><br>And
for anyone who had been hoping to contribute to PolyGlot, I’ve vastly
cleaned up the repository. If you pull using netbeans, you should be
able to compile with zero modifications.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>This manual is updated to look quite a bit nicer (pretty hard on the eyes before!)</li>
<li>Gender functionality removed from PolyGlot (replaced)</li>
<li>Class system implemented in PolyGlot (takes care of gender and many other possibilities)</li>
<li>Cleaned up the GitHub repository</li>
<li>Fonts now default to Charis, a Unicode compatible font</li>
<li>Renamed everything having to do with the "Thesaurus" to "Family." (actual thesaurus will come later)</li>
<li>Standardized a lot of menus and cleaned up the look of PolyGlot quite a bit</li>
<li>As always, a ton of bugs squashed.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<a name="INSTALLATION"></a>
<h1>INSTALLATION</h1><br>
PolyGlot is a Java program, and requires the Java Virtual Machine 1.8
or higher to run. This is available for free at <a href="https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a>.
PolyGlot will run on any version of Java newer than Java 1.8, but it is
recommended that you have the highest version your operating system
will support.<br>
<br>
If Java is installed, you only need to unzip the contents of the
PolyGlot program to a folder and double click PolyGlot.jar. Most
operating systems should be able to unzip files, but programs such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7Zip</a> are available online for free. <br>
<br>
As a note, PolyGlot <span style="font-style: italic;">MUST</span> be
unzipped to function correctly. It cannot be run from within the zip
file that you've downloaded, and many of its functions will fail in
unpredictable ways if you attempt to do so.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR LINUX USERS</span>: Before
using PolyGlot, most users of Linux will have to make the jar file
executable. To do this, open a command prompt, navigate to the folder
you have extracted PolyGlot to, and enter the following line: "chmod +x
PolyGlot.jar". Depending on your settings, you may need to enter your
admin password to do this.<br>
<br>
Additionally, some builds of Linux come with OpenJDK 7, which does not
include JavaFX (a necessary component for PolyGlot's interface). Please
upgrade to OpenJDK 8 if you're using Linux and still on 7. This can be
done through the Package Manager and search for JavaFX or the full
name, java-openjfx.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE FOR ARCH LINUX USERS: </span>You
must install JFX manually to properly use PolyGlot.<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="BASIC_FUNCTIONALITY"></a><h1>BASIC FUNCTIONALITY</h1>
<br>
<br>
When you first open PolyGlot, you'll see the Main Menu, a series of
toggle buttons that will open up all of the main tools that you will
use to create and maintain your conlan.<br>
<img alt="" src="assets/MainMenu.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
If you click the Lexicon button, you'll see an empty dictionary. If
you
have an Excel sheet with a language that preexists, you can skip to
section 2, which goes over how to import them. Otherwise, keep reading
to see how to start your dictionary! Below is the screen you'll see
most often when editing your wordlist. I have loaded Lodenkur, my own
conlang, as an example.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 504px; height: 457px;" alt="" src="assets/Lex1.png"><br>
<br>
Adding and removing words is done with the + and - buttons beneath the
word list on the left. On the right are all of the word properties.
Below is what the window looks like after creating a new word. As you
can see, the various properties are blank, but labeled until they are
filled in. As a note, there will be nothing to select under -- Types --
or -- Gender -- until you create type and genders to apply to words. (NOTE: Here, gender is an added class for words. Adding classes to word types is covered later in the word class section of this document.)<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 504px; height: 457px;" alt="" src="assets/Lex2.png"><br>
<br>
The current word is illegal, as the ConWord field is completely blank.
The reason for the illegality is displayed in the error box, with the
offending field highlighted in red. You can set other constraints to
word legality elsewhere, but the ConWord being more than a blank space
is one unalterable rule.<br>
<br>
The NatLang field is where you put the natural language synonym (if
any) for the word. The type dropbox allows you to give a part of speech
to the word.<br>
<br>
The pronunciation filed can be filled in manually, but it is more
typical for users to define orthographies which will autopopulate this
field. If you select the checkbox to the right of the pronunciation
field, autogeneration of pronunciation for this word will be
overridden, allowing words with exception pronunciations.<br>
<br>
The Override Rules checkbox will tell PolyGlot that you wish to enter a
word which breaks typical rules, and will unlock the lexicon list, even
if the word would otherwise be illegal.<br>
<br>
In the definition field, you can write a more freeform definition of
your word. This is particularly useful for words that have no direct
translation.<br>

<br>
The Declensions and Logographs buttons open windows to functionality
that is described in full later in this document.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you click the Search/Filter bar along the top of the Lexicon window,
a filter menu slides down (shown below). Here, you can filter words by
any of their main properties. The ConWord filter field will filter not
only on headwords, but also any declensions/conjugations of words.
Fields are compatible with regex expressions.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 519px; height: 457px;" alt="" src="assets/Lex3.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="-_Word_Types"></a>- Word Types<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<img style="width: 494px; height: 398px;" alt="" src="assets/Types1.png"><br>
Word types are the parts of speech of your language,
and can be accessed via the Types window by clicking Types on the main
menu. Every word you create in
PolyGlot may be assigned a type from the list that you define. The
screen that comes up will allow
you to add new types, which represent parts of speech. Nouns, verbs,
adjectives and whatever other types of words your language uses should
be created here. Once created, they will populate in the drop down
boxes of the main screen. You can name the types and add notes as is
appropriate. Types can be added and deleted with the respective buttons
on the above screen.<br>

<br>
The name field allows you to give the type a name.<br>
<br>
The notes field is useful for defining types that are nonstandard.<br>
<br>
The pattern field allows you to restrict the forms that words of a
given type may take via a regular expression. For example, the pattern
".*ru$" would tell PolyGlot that all words of a given type must end in
the characters "ru".<br>
<br>
The Conjugations/Declensions setup and the Conjugations/Declensions
Autogeneration are advanced features covered in the next section of
this guide.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Pronunciation Mandatory checkbox tells PolyGlot that pronunciations
are mandatory for this type.<br>

<br>
The Definition Mandatory checkbox tells PolyGlot that definitions are
mandatory for this type.
</p>

<p><a name="-_ConjugationsDeclensions"></a><h1>Conjugations/Declensions</h1>
<br>
Conjugations and declensions are one of
the more complex features of PolyGlot. They are used to store alternate
forms of words. Most commonly, verbs will be conjugated to show present
vs. past tense, but there are many different ways that a conjugation
can encode meaning in a language. It is in the cases of a more complex
system of conjugation/declension that the system in PolyGlot shines.
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 494px; height: 398px;" alt="" src="assets/Types2.png"><br>
<br>
To edit the conjugations/declensions associated with a word type,
select the type and click the "Conjugations/Declensions Setup" button
on the
Types window. The example below is not of Lodenkur, but an arbitrary
language, to give a better idea of how to use regular expressions
(which Lodenkur lacks the correct characterset to represent currently).<br>
<br>

<img style="width: 349px; height: 455px;" alt="" src="assets/conj2.png"><br>
<br>
In the types window, I selected "verb," and clicked the
Conjugations/Declensions button. In the window that appeared, I used
the circled + button to add two declension headers. "Tense" and
"speaker Gender."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 700px; height: 455px;" alt="" src="assets/conj3.png"><br>
Using the circled + button, I first create two dimensions for the Tense
header, then select "Speaker Gender" and add three dimensions to it.
Note that "mandatory" is selected for the "past" dimension. This means
that all conjugations/declensions for words of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">verb</span> type that include the the past
dimension of the conjugation "tense" will be required on words of type <span style="font-weight: bold;">verb</span>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 412px; height: 328px;" alt="" src="assets/Types4.png"><br>

<br>
Back on theLexicon window, a word of type <span style="font-weight: bold;">verb</span> is selected. This is the type
that conjugations have been created for. From here, click on the
"Conword Declensions" button.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 370px; height: 234px;" alt="" src="assets/conj5.png"><br>
Forms
for every logical combination of dimensions may be saved here. As you
can see, male, female and neuter forms of both past and present tenses
have fields generated, which you may fill in as is appropriate.
Although it may be tedious to fill out every form for every word, this
is particularly useful for nonstandard conjugations and exception
forms. Word forms typed here will be persisted/modified if
OK is clicked, and any changed will be discarded if Cancel is clicked.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 370px; height: 315px;" alt="" src="assets/conj6.png"><br>
If a new conjugation/declension is created, or if one is deleted, the
old forms are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
simply deleted. Here, I have removed the conjugation for gender and
returned to the Conjugation/Declension screen for "zerf." The
deprecated forms of the word are displayed below. Once you have
reworked them into their newer, appropriate forms, you can delete them
and click "OK," to remove the deprecated forms from the word. If they
are not deleted, they will persist as you have left them, and will at
no point be discarded without explicit user action.<br></p>

<p><a name="-_Autogeneration_of"></a><h1>Autogeneration of
Conjugations/Declensions</h1><br>
One of the more complex features to
PolyGlot is the Autogeneration system for conjugations and declensions.
This section goes through a basic setup to create a conjugation system.
The dictionary used here as an example is included along with PolyGlot
as the file exampleAutoGen.pgt. For those of you unfamiliar with
regular expressions, links to excellent tutorials exist in the <a href="readme.html#ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES">Additional Resources</a>
section of this document.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 494px; height: 398px;" alt="" src="assets/Types3.png"><br>
<br>
Before autogeneration rules can be created, conjugations/declensions
for a type must exist (as explained in <a href="readme.html#-_ConjugationsDeclensions">Conjugations/Declensions</a>).
Once this is done, go to the Types tab, select the part of speech to
create autogeneration rules for, and click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conj/Decl Autogeneration</span> button.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 585px; height: 543px;" alt="" src="assets/autoGen2.png"><br>
<br>
Here, there are a number of controls. In the leftmost column, you see
every possible conjugation of the selected word type (verb in this
example case). To create transformation rules click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>
button beneath the rules column. In the example picture, one rule,
"past" has been created. The rightmost section of the window contains
the rule's properties. The rule's can be set to anything, and is simply
a mnemonic to help you remember what precisely it applies to.&nbsp; The
rule regex dictates which words the rule applies to. In the example, I
have made a wild card, applying it to all verbs, but I could make two
separate rules, with the regex entries "^a.*" and "^!a.*". This would
make one rule for verbs starting with the letter 'a' and one rule for
all words which do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> start
with the letter 'a.'<br>
<br>
Beneath this is the Transformations table. Each rule may have as many
transformations as you like. They will be applied (in the order which
they appear) to any word that meets the regex pattern for the rule.
Here, there is only one rule. The regex that it matches is simply the
end of the word, and the replacement text is "ed." The visible setup
will follow these steps when autogenerating past tense conjugation for
a verb:<br>

<ol>
  <li>Check to see whether the verb matches the regex of the first
rule (the regex for our "past" rule matches all strings, so this is
guaranteed)</li>
  <li>In the order which they appear, apply each transformation to the
word.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>See if the first transformation regex matches any strings in
the
word (the example simply looks for the end of the string, guaranteed to
exist)</li>
    <li>If the transformation matches, it replaces matching text within
the word with the replacement string (here, "ed")</li>
    <li>The process moves on to apply the next transformation (although
there is only one in the example)</li>

  </ol>
  <li>The process moves on to the next rule (although in the example,
there is only one rule)</li>
</ol>
This process happens for each of the conjugations that you create
autogeneration rules for. Although the rules in this example are very
simplistic, regular expressions can be used to create highly complex
sets of conjugations and declensions, with exceptions, special rules,
and very specific forms.<br>
<br>
To the right of both the rules and the Transformations lists, you will
see up and down arrow buttons. This moves rules and transforms up and
down in terms of priority. Each rule and each transform is applied to a
word in order of precedence, so this can help you to mofdify complex
conjugation/declension procedures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 564px; height: 539px;" alt="" src="assets/autoGen3.png"><br>
<br>
Above is the setup for present tense.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 564px; height: 539px;" alt="" src="assets/autoGen4.png"><br>
<br>
And here is the setup for future tense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 308px; height: 201px;" alt="" src="assets/ruleCopyPaste.png"><br>
<br>
By right clicking, rules can be copied and pasted in the rules list.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 412px; height: 328px;" alt="" src="assets/Types4.png"><br>
<br>

Once these steps are complete, I return to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lexicon</span> tab, create a verb, and
click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conword Declensions </span>button.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 371px; height: 152px;" alt="" src="assets/autoGen6.png"><br>
<br>
Here, all of the forms for the word "walk" have been automatically
generated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 371px; height: 152px;" alt="" src="assets/autoGen7.png"><br>
<br>

If you would like to turn off autogeneration for a particular word
which is a unique exception, click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Autogen
Override</span> check box on the word's Conjugations/Declensions screen.<br>

<p>
One of the more complex features to
PolyGlot is the Autogeneration system for conjugations and declensions.
This section goes through a basic setup to create a conjugation system.
The dictionary used here as an example is included along with PolyGlot

<br>
Before autogeneration rules can be created, conjugations/declensions
for a type must exist (as explained in <a href="readme.html#-_ConjugationsDeclensions">Conjugations/Declensions</a>).
Once this is done, go to the Types tab, select the part of speech to
create autogeneration rules for, and click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conj/Decl Autogeneration</span> button.<br>

<br>

there is only one in the example)</li>

  </ol>

<br>

Once these steps are complete, I return to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lexicon</span> tab, create a verb, and
click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conword Declensions </span>button.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 371px; height: 152px;" alt="" src="assets/autoGen6.png"><br>

</p>

<p>
<a name ="CLASSES"></a><h1>Word Classes</h1><br>
Word class is most familiar as grammatical gender. Classes can be added to words by clicking the Lexical Classes button on the main menu. This functionality replaces the hard coded Gender module in prior versions. As many classes as you like, with as many values as you find necessary may be added to words. If your language used gender, it will automatically be converted to a word class, and you will notice no difference in your language.<br><br>

<img src="assets/wordClass01.png"><br>
In this example, I have added two classes, gender and distance. To the distance class, I have added three values: touching, visible, and distant. To the right, all of the parts of speech for my language are listed. Only nouns are checked, so the distance class will only be applied to nouns.<br><br>
<img src="assets/wordClass02.png"><br>
As you can see, the word “run” is a verb, and has no classes attached.<br><br>
<img src="assets/wordClass03.png"><br>
The word “flower,” however is a noun, which I have set both gender and distance to apply to. Both can be seen beneath the part of speech, and appear as soon as it is selected.<br><br>
<img src="assets/wordClass04.png"><br>
When the distance dropdown is selected, all of the values we entered earlier are visible and may be selected for the active word.

<a name="-_Word_Quickentry"></a><h1>Word Quickentry</h1>
<br>
The Word Quickentry window allows users
to very quickly add words to their dictionaries. It is designed to be
used entirely with the keyboard without any need to use the mouse until
all entries are complete. To open the quickentry window, click the
Quickentry button in the main menu.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 372px; height: 405px;" alt="" src="assets/quickEntry2.png"><br>
<br>
Here we see the quickentry screen. All of the basic word properties can
be seen here. The Con Word field is highlighted red, as it is a
required field. If you have your language set to require Local Word or
Type, those fields will be highlighted as well. Each of the fields can
be navigated via the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tab</span> key.
Once all the fields have been completed to your liking, hitting the <span style="font-style: italic;">Enter/Return</span> key will save the word
to your dictionary, blank the fields, and reselect the first field to
begin the process again.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 372px; height: 405px;" alt="" src="assets/quickEntry3.png"><br>
<br>
Not all languages will use every field. If your language does not use
one of the fields, you can un-check the field's active box to disable
it. In the example above, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gender</span>
has been disabled. This means that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tab</span> key will skip selecting it, and
speed up your entries.<br>
<br>
Once you are done, simply close the window or hit the Done button.<br>
<br>
As a note, the quickentry window will enforce rules that the user has
set. It will not allow a word that lacks a type if types are set to
mandatory. It will not allow a duplicate Con Word is mandatory
uniqueness is set.<br>

<p>
<a name="-_Language_Properties"></a><h1>Language Properties</h1>
<br>
<img style="width: 410px; height: 500px;" alt="" src="assets/prop.png"><br>
This screen allows various properties of the ConLang to be modified.
Below are explanations for each.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Language Name<br>
The name of your constructed language.<br>
<br>
- Local Language
<br>
The natural language that you are using while writing your
dictionary/language rules.<br>
<br>
- Author/Copyright Info<br>

Here you can include any information that you the creator want packaged with
your language, including personal contact information, copyright
information, etc.<br>
<br>
- Conlang Font<br>
Many ConLangs use nonstandard character sets, and it is sometimes
easiest to simply create a font yourself and map these characters to
standard Unicode characters. To load a font, click the Conlang Font
button and select from the list of locally installed fonts. All Conlang
fields will appear in the appropriate font. As a note, if you wish to
send your saved dictionary to a friend who is also using PolyGlot, you
must also send them the font, or they will receive an error message
when they load your dictionary, and see standard characters, rather
than your custom font.<br>
<br>
- Alphabetical Order<br>
This allows you to create a custom
alphabetical order for the
characters used in your language. Simply list the characters in your
alphabetical order in this text box, and PolyGlot will respect it when
reordering words in the dictionary. Any characters not provided here
will be ordered in standard fashion (as decided by your operating
system). Here, I have set the alphabetic order to follow qwerty. This
will order the dictionary and any alphabetically ordered fields with
the order you provide.<br>
<br>
-Pronunciation<br>
<img style="width: 199px; height: 283px;" alt="" src="assets/pron1.png"><br>
<br>

The above image shows the Character Pronunciation guide. New rows can
be added with the Add button, and selected columns can be deleted with
the Delete button. The Character(s) row represents one character or a
series of characters that make up a sound or phoneme. The Pronunciation
column represents the sound or phoneme associated with the contents of
the Character(s) column of the same row. This allows PolyGlot to
auto-generate pronunciations for you when you create new words, and can
save a lot of time. Both columns are compatible with regular
expressions (explained below).<br>
<br>
Of note is the both upper and lower cases must be entered into the
pronunciation guide unless both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore
Case</span> option and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable
Proc Regex</span> options are selected.<br>
<br>
The order that the sets appear in represents their <span style="font-style: italic;">priority</span>.
Higher position means higher priority. In the example, you can see that
the pair "gh-&gt;j" is higher than both "g-&gt;guh" and "h-&gt;h". This
means that if PolyGlot encounters "gh", it will attempt to create a
valid pronunciation using the "gh-&gt;j" rule before either of the
others. By selecting a row and clicking the up or down arrow to the
right of the guide, you can move a set to higher or lower priorities in
the guide. <br>

<br>
In addition to the basic functionality, the pronunciation guide is
compatible with regular expressions. For example, if you added the pair
"^th" -&gt; "θ", it would replace "th" <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
when it appeared at the beginning of a word. This allows for deep
orthographies to be easily be created. Links in the references section
of this document lead to good regular expression tutorials.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WORD OF WARNING:</span> Please be sure
to type in the "Character(s)" field in the exact same way as you are
going to be entering your words. I have encountered users that have
accidentally entered lookalike characters into the left-hand column.
This will mean that you cannot properly use the autopopulate feature.
Keep in mind that just because "<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 514px; height: 222px;" alt="" src="assets/pron2.png"><br>
<br>

Back on the Dictionary tab, the pronunciation of our new word has
auto-populated! For more complex languages that use IPA pronunciation
standards, or other symbols, this can save a lot of tedious work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 197px; height: 221px;" alt="" src="assets/langProp2.png"><br>
<br>
The last element of the Properties tab is the language check box
settings. Here, you can tell PolyGlot to enforce rules within your
lexicon. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Types Mandatory</span> is
selected, all words must have a type set to be saved. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Mandatory</span> is set, all words
must have a Local Word property set to be saved. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Word Uniqueness </span>is set, homonyms
within your conlang will be forbidden. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Local Uniqueness</span>

is set, no two constructed words may contain identical text for their
Local Word property. If you create a word that violates any rules that
you have chosen to enforce, PolyGlot will prevent you from selecting
other words until it is corrected, and display an error message telling
you what to do to correct this.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignore Case</span> check box will
make all features (excepting the pronunciation options) ignore upper
vs. lower case characters in your dictionary. To disable regex
functionality in the pronunciations (thereby allowing ignore case to
apply to them as well), click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disable
Proc Regex</span> option.<br>
<br>
If your language uses Right to Left style writing, select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforce RTL </span>checkbox. This will
make instances of your conlang appear/be written in the correct
direction through the program. <br>

<p>
<a name="-_Family_Window"></a><h1>Family Window &nbsp; </h1>
<br>
<img style="width: 211px; height: 156px;" alt="" src="assets/thes1.png"><br>
<br>
The Lexical Family window is primarily a lexical organization tool, but can
be helpful in many ways. To access the window, click the Lexical Families button on the main menu.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 380px; height: 503px;" alt="" src="assets/thes2.png"><br>
The Families window gives a hierarchical tree view on the left, with a
name, a list of words in a family, and notes associated with the
family. This tool is particularly useful for keeping track of groupings
of words that derive from one another, or that are in some way
connected, whether through connotation, denotation, etymology, or any
thing else. The nature of a the relationship can be recorded easily in
the Notes field.<br>
<br>

<br>
<img style="width: 841px; height: 669px;" alt="" src="assets/thes3.png"><br>
<br>
In this example, I have created two entries in the thesaurus node
("body" and "death") which represent families of words within Lodenkur.
I have done this by clicking the + button in the lower left-hand corner
of the window and changing the names of the families on the right once
selected. After this, the newly created "body" node was selected on the
left. Words have been added to the list of family words. This has been
done by selecting words in the main window's lexicon, and clicking the
circled + button on the right. Multiple instances of the same word
cannot be added to the same family.<br>
<br>
The words added here are for a living body and an inanimate body. They
are both logically and lexically related, so I have grouped them
together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 352px; height: 474px;" alt="" src="assets/thes4.png"><br>
<br>
Here, I have created a subfamily, "limbs." This was done by selecting
the "body" family, then clicking the + button in the lower left-hand
corner. To this family, the words for "arm" and "leg" have been added
because they are lexically related to one another. The word for "hand"
has been added because it is logically related.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 354px; height: 474px;" alt="" src="assets/thes5.png"><br>

<br>
There are times when it is useful to see all words in a family,
including those that are in all subfamilies. To do this, click the
"include subfamilies" check box. In the example, all words from within
the "body" and the "limbs" families are included. As a note, words
cannot be deleted from the "Words in family" list while this box is
checked.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 841px; height: 669px;" alt="" src="assets/thes6.png"><br>
<br>
Of note is that when a word is selected in the Families Window, it
will be auto-selected in the dictionary lexicon. This can be useful for
vocabularies that have not been wholly committed to memory.<br>

<a name="-_Checking_for_Updates"></a><h1>Checking for Updates</h1>
<img style="width: 187px; height: 132px;" alt="" src="assets/update.png"><br>
<br>
PolyGlot will automatically check online for updates at startup,
but
you can also tell it manually to check. To do so, simply click
Help-&gt;Check for Updates. A dialog will then appear telling you
either that you are up to date, or with details on the newest version

<a name="IMPORTING_FROM_EXCEL"></a><h1>Importing/Exporting to/from Excel (or CSV files)</h1>
<br>
<img style="width: 179px; height: 159px;" alt="" src="assets/excelImport2.png"><br>
<br>
As many conlangers use excel sheets and CSV files to store their
languages, this is
one of the most useful features for migrating a language into a
PolyGlot library! If you have a conlang that is currently stored in an
excel file, you can import it via the excel/CSV import tool included in
PolyGlot. To access this tool, click Tools-&gt;Import From File Sheet
in the
menu.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The screen that appears has a number of different fields and options.<br>
<img style="width: 505px; height: 472px;" alt="" src="assets/excelImport.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
- Import File<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the Excel/CSV file that you are importing
data
from. Simply click the browse button and select your excel spreadsheet
file here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- First Row Is Labels<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the first row in your dictionary file is used for
labels, click this. This will tell PolyGlot to skip the first row
before beginning the import.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Column Mapping<br>
<br>
&amp;nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the meat and potatoes of the import
tool.
Here, you map columns from your excel sheet to fields in PloyGlot. The
column number (rather than the column title) should be used for
mapping. Remember, in Excel, column numbers begin at 0, rather than 1.
If you have more columns than are provided for in PolyGlot, multiple
columns can be imported to a single PolyGlot field. Simply enter the
column numbers separated by commas.<br>
<br>
- Delimiter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delimiter character is the character used to
separate columns in a CSV file. If you are importing from an excel file
or the CSV file you're using has commas as delimiters, you may ignore
this field.<br>

<br>
- Excel Sheet<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use multiple sheets for your dictionary, you will
have to import them one at a time. The sheet that you are importing
from is set here. If you do not use multiple sheets, simply leave it to
its default value of 0.<br>
<br>
- Exporting<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 274px; height: 206px;" alt="" src="assets/Excel2.png"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exporting from PolyGlot is very simple. Simply click
Tools-&gt; Export to Excel and select a path/filename to export to. An
excel file with separate sheets for vocab, types, word classes, and
pronunciations will be created.

<p>
<a name="TRANSLATION_WINDOW"></a><h1Translation Window</h1>
<br>
NOTE: THE TRANSLATION WINDOW IS BEING LEFT IN POLYGLOT BY REQUEST, BUT
IS CONSIDERED DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY. NEW FUNCTIONALITY WILL
ENHANCE/REPLACE THIS LATER IN DEVELOPMENT.<br>
<br>
The translation window is a brand new feature in PolyGlot, and very
much in its infancy. I believe that it is currently very useful, but
there is a LOT to be done before it reaches its full potential. At its
core, the window is (and will continue to be) a tool to assist with the
translation of text. Auto-translation tools are currently very poor,
and I think that by combining some of the techniques of
auto-translators with a human being, the process of translating texts
can be massively sped up, while still allowing for a high degree of
accuracy. In the example below, I will walk you through this process
using Lodenkur, my own ConLang.<br>

<br>
<img style="width: 439px; height: 278px;" alt="" src="assets/trans1.png"><br>
First, click Tools-&gt;Translation Window<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 656px; height: 473px;" alt="" src="assets/trans2.png"><br>
The translation window will pop up. Of note here is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reset</span> button. It can be clicked at
any time to erase all current work and start a translation from scratch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 509px; height: 265px;" alt="" src="assets/trans3.png"><br>
In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Text To Translate</span> box,
I type a sentence I wish to translate, then click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Begin Translation </span>button.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1176px; height: 652px;" alt="" src="assets/trans4.png"><br>
At this point, a number of things happen. First, the right side of the
window will activate. This will populate the word currently being
transliterated to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching On</span>
field, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Matches</span>
list box will populate, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation</span>
field will populate with whatever is currently selected in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Matches</span> list box. At the
same time, the lexicon back on the main interface window will tie
itself to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Matches</span>

list box.<br>
<br>
The first word in the sentence is highlighted, and copied into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching on</span>
text box. Using ranking algorithms, PolyGlot finds a list of words in
descending order that it believes might be synonymous, or related to
the word you are currently looking to translate. When you select a word
from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Matches</span>, it will
make the lexicon (in the main PolyGlot window) jump to the matching
entry, allowing you to make certain it is correct. The word will also
be copied into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation</span>
field.<br>
<br>
If the word you are looking for is not being found, you can edit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching On</span> box, and words will be
searched/ranked in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Matches</span>

in real time while you type. If the word has no corollary in your
conlang, you can click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create New</span>
button to create a word within your language to fill this gap. If you
would like to use a one off word that you do not wish to save into your
dictionary, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation</span>
text box may be altered to any text you like.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 141px; height: 119px;" alt="" src="assets/trans5.png"><br>
From here, you can click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use</span>
or the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skip</span> button to move on
to the next word. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use</span> will
copy the text within the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation</span>

field into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transliteration Text</span>
box. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skip</span>
will simply move on to the next word. For languages such as Lodenkur,
where there are no articles, or multiple words that collapse into a
single, unified word within your conlang, this can be very useful.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 656px; height: 474px;" alt="" src="assets/trans6.png"><br>
After clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use</span>, the
selected translation for "I" is copied into the&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transliterated Text</span> box, and in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Text To Translate</span>

box, the next word is selected. Using these techniques, continue to
translate and/or skip words. Do not worry about word order or
additional necessary grammar for now, that will be addressed in the
final step.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 298px; height: 472px;" alt="" src="assets/trans7.png"><br>
Here, PolyGlot has picked up punctuation along with the word, and has
not found the corollary word in Lodenkur as a result. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching On</span> box is edited
appropriately, and the correct word appears in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible Matches</span>
box. Punctuation has been left as searchable and legal for PolyGlot, as
some languages use fonts with letters taking the place of characters
that are typically punctuation marks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1197px; height: 475px;" alt="" src="assets/trans8.png"><br>
From here, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation Window</span>

enters into its last step. The right side of the window deactivates,
and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Translation Text Window</span>
opens. This is a freely editable window where you can manipulate your
text from a simple transliteration, to a true translated form, with
conjugations, declensions and proper grammar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 653px; height: 473px;" alt="" src="assets/trans9.png"><br>
While in this final mode, you can click on any word (or multi-word
text, if you added this via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Translation</span>
field) in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transliterated Text</span>
box, and both that word, and its related word in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Text To Translate</span> box will be
highlighted. This is very useful when keeping track of which words go
where while you make your final translation.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 546px; height: 352px;" alt="" src="assets/trans10.png"><br>
And here is the final product! The sentence "I will eat the food,"
translated into Lodenkur. Ready to copy/paste wherever I like, and
bother people who aren't nerdy enough to appreciate conlanging.<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="STATISTICS_REPORT"></a><h1>Statistics Report</h1>
<br>
As with the Translation Window, I will be using Lodenkur for this
example. An HTML report is generated and displayed. The report
generated from Lodenkur can be viewed <a href="exStats.html">here</a>.
Of note is that this might take a a few moments to run. The report
calculates some fairly complex statistics, and has to do a lot of
comparison to build the full report. Don't assume the program has
frozen if it takes some time. The report currently provides:<br>

<a name="LOGOGRAPHIC_DICTIONARY"></a><h1>Logographic Dictionary</h1>
<br>
The logographic dictionary tool in PolyGlot allows for the creation of
highly complex character sets. It can handle true logographies, where
each symbol is directly correlated with a single word, or systems such
as Chinese, which associate multiple readings with a single character,
and build more complex characters out of radicals. Once created, these
characters can be tied directly to words in a lexicon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 295px; height: 103px;" alt="" src="assets/logo1.png"><br>

<br>
To access the logographic dictionary, click View-&gt;Logographic
Dictionary.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 621px; height: 638px;" alt="" src="assets/logo2.png"><br>
<br>
The logograph dictionary if very similar to the Lexicon in PolyGlot.
The list to the left displays all currently created logographs, and can
be added to/deleted from with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> buttons. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes</span>

fields have the same function as those in the Lexicon. The
Filter/Search fileds in the top are applied in real time, as with the
Lexicon.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Strokes</span> field accepts only
integer values. This represents the number of strokes that a logograph
takes to write. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is Radical</span>
checkbox is used to mark whether the current logograph is used as a
radical in the construction of more complex logographs. If this is
selected, you will be able to add the character to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radicals</span> list of other words.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Readings</span> list allows you
to
record various readings/pronunciations for a given logograph. As each
line is added, it can be freely edited.<br>

<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Related Words</span> list is non
editable. This is generated by PolyGlot after fetching a list of all
words to which an association with the logograph has been added.<br>
<br>
Logographs are created based on user defined images. To load an image
into a logograph's properties, create a new logograph in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logograph List</span> and click the Load
Image button. The same button can be used to replace an existing image.<br>
<br>
Under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radicals</span>, clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span> button once will bring up the
Logograph Radicals selection tool. Once this is open, clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">+ </span>a second time will result in the
radical being added to the currently selected logograph.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 959px; height: 640px;" alt="" src="assets/logo3.png"><br>
<br>
Here, three test logographs have been entered, and using the
Logographic Radicals selector (opened the first time <span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span> was clicked), the radicals TEST 1
and TEST 2, which make up TEST 3 have been added to the logograph.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 444px; height: 582px;" alt="" src="assets/logo4.png"><br>
<br>
To associate logographs with a word, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logographs</span> button while the word is
selected in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lexicon</span>.<br>

<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 955px; height: 640px;" alt="" src="assets/logo5.png"><br>

<a name="PRINT_PDF"></a><h1>Publishing To PDF</h1>
<br>
The Publish to PDF screen presents a series of options that will be
applied to a PDF document generated from your language file. The
document will be fully formatted and is a clean, presentable way to
package your language for distribution.
To access this feature, click File -&gt; Publish to PDF or Ctrl+P
(Option+P on macs). All images, fonts, and assets used by your language
will be embedded directly in the PDF file, so you will not have to
distribute anything with it to ensure that the PDF displays correctly
on any given computer. As a note, sound files included in the grammar
section currently cannot be embedded in the PDF. This is being looked
into for future releases.<br>
<br>

<img src="assets/printPdf1.png"><br>
The window pictured above allows you to publish with various options
described below.<br>
<br>
The top option is the location that the PDF document should be
generated in. Click Select location to specify this.<br>
<br>
The Title, Subtitle and Cover Image will make up the first page of your
document. None of these fields are required, but if no Title is given,
the document will be given a header of your language’s name.
Additionally, any copyright information that you have included for your
language will be printed here.<br>
<br>
Next, a Table of Contents is generated and printed. This is created
automatically, and provides links to the various sections of your
document that you have chosen to print. Clicking on any of the chapter
or subchapter titles here will make the PDF reader jump directly to
them.<br>
<br>
The third page is devoted to any foreword text that you have provided.
This section is optional, and the page will be skipped if none is
provided.<br>
<br>
If Print Orthography is selected, a section will be devoted to a chart
which shows character(s) paired with their appropriate pronunciations.<br>

<br>
If Print Gloss Key is selected, a section will be devoted to a chart
which displays parts of speech in your language linked with their
appropriate glosses.<br>
<br>
If Print CONLANG -&gt; LOCAL LANGUAGE is selected, a dictionary will be
generated in the alphabetic order of your conlang, with each word
having a formatted entry that gives its type (by gloss if defined), its
pronunciation (if one exists), its definition, and any synonyms that
you have provided.<br>
<br>
The Print LOCAL LANGUAGE -&gt; CONLANG option functions identically to
the one above, except that the dictionary is based on local language
words, and in the alphabetic order that the user’s machine defaults to.<br>
<br>
The Print Grammar option tells PolyGlot to include all chapters that
you have written in your Grammar Guide. Formatting choices such as
preserving inline conlang fonts and color are preserved. The Grammar
Guide will have its own chapter in the ToC, with subchapters listed
beneath it representing the sections created within your guide.<br>
<br>

The Print Logographs option is not currently available. If you use
logographs in your language and need this to be integrated with the
logographic engine in PolyGlot, drop me a line, and I’ll make it
happen. As of now, I don’t believe there are any users leveraging this
functionality.<br>
<br>
The Print Page Number option will add a footer to your document which
gives current and total page count for the entirety of the document.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="IPA_WINDOW"></a><h1>Interactive IPA Window</h1>
<br>
<img src="assets/IPA1.png"><br>
The International Phonetic Alphabet is a series of characters created
with the goal of representing each unique sound that can be part of
spoken language. If you’re looking to try out new sounds or find
combinations of sounds that build a coherent orthography for a new
language, this can be very useful. Try playing around and finding which
sounds flow into one another and before long, you’ll have the sound and
feel of a new language. It can be accessed by clicking
Tools-&gt;Interactive IP Chart.<br>
<br>
The Interactive IPA chart is a useful tool for establishing the
orthography of your language. It is separated by tabs into Vowels,
Pulmonic Consonants, Non-Pulmonic Consonants, and Other/Affricates. If
you click on any of the characters, PolyGlot will play the associated
sound and copy the character into the textbox in the bottom of the
window.
<br>
</p>

<p>
<a name="LODENKUR_-_an_example_language"></a><h1> Grammar Guide</h1>
<br>
The Grammar Guide allows you to organize gramatical rules of your
language in easy to read and traverse chapters/sections. It it a
powerful tool which allows complex formatting of text to best describe
grammar to users. To access it, click the Grammar button on the main
menu.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 760px; height: 456px;" alt="" src="assets/grammar1.png"><br>
<br>

This window is one of the more complex elements of PolyGlot, but also
one of the most powerful.<br>
<br>
On the left is the chapter and section tree. By clicking the Chapter
button, a new chapter is added below the currently selected position.
Chapters cannot be nested. The + button adds new sections to the
currently selected chapter. The - button deletes a chapter or section.
Delete with care, PolyGlot has no undo!<br>
<br>
The name field allows you to name your chapter/section.<br>
<br>
The text field allows you to write out grammar rules. Text format can
be modified by highlighting text, changing the values of the font menu
above the text box, and clicking Apply. If your language uses RTL
writing, it will display as such here when you select your conlang's
font in the font dropdown.<br>
<br>
The Spoken Example menu allows you to record and play back speech in
your conlang. This is especially useful when your language uses
particular tones or inflections that it is difficult to describe in
simple text.<br>

<a name="ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES"></a><h1>Additional Resources</h1>
<br>
The following sites are excellent for creating your
own fonts for use within PolyGlot, and all fonts created with them
should be fully compatible (although custom kerning is still a future
feature). The custom font for Lodenkur, Kukun Linear A, was created
with Fontstruct, although future versions will likely be created with
FontContstructor.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following sites are invaluable to anyone getting
into language construction for the first time. Please check them out!
The first two are resources to read through yourself, and the last is a
community of very friendly people who are passionate about creating and
refining constructed languages.<br>
